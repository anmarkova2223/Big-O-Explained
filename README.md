# Big O Explained Project

This repo contains code using Javascript, Svelte, D3, and HTML to create a <a href = "https://zoeludena.github.io/Big-O-Explained/">GitHub page</a> that will explain Big O notation. We have an expectation that those using this website are familiar with python and code to a certain degree. This is the final project for DSC 106 at UCSD. DSC 106 is a class about data visualizations. This course introduces the principles, techniques, and algorithms for creating effective data visualizations. The class also touched on computer graphics, human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology, design, statistical graphics, and synthesis relevant ideas.

# Our team: Graphic Girls

Our team is comprised of: Zoe Ludena, Anastasiya Markova, and Maryam Almahasnah. We worked together in order to produce the idea and code for this project. Our goal is to explain Big O notation to those who have never seen it before. We know there are many different resources, but we thought it would be nice to compile it all in a single location. We plan to share this Github Page with those who might need help learning how to calculate Big O notation.
